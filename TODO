TODO List

* Sort out documentation
* Add first draft of Centos-7 spec-file (as an example)
* Get rid of this build system (bring here autotools || cmake || meson, whatever makes it easy to complete)
* Remove former github pages from this particular repo and move it to separate one.

Help wanted:
* update ebuilds
* new debian package stuff
* other packaging artifacts for different systems and distributions
* gtk-3 port
